            <h1><strong>Bella</strong> Kyutie<h4>I have a pet whose name is Bella. Bella is 9 months tomorrow February 22. Bella was born on May 22, 2021. She came to us on July 14, Bella was very small and quiet then. Now, he's been 9 months old and he's very kind to all the dogs I've met. Bella is also a very tender and understanding dog as if she understands when I am happy or sad. Bella's hobbies are catching insects or flies and chewing on mama's slippers.</h4></h1><br>
            <p class="Bella-text">Short of the love between a parent and their child, there may not be another love as pure and wonderful as the love between a person and their dog. Nurturing, attentive, and always up for playtime, dogs are a quintessential part of country life, and we can't picture our lives without at least one. All of the dog quotes we've gathered here aren't just intended to make you happy; they'll also remind you of the special bond of friendship we have with our dogs.
        
            From funny quotes about dogs (like Elayne Boosler's "My fashion philosophy is, if you're not covered in dog hair, your life is empty") to quotes about the bond between dog lovers and their pups ("The love of a dog is a pure thing. He gives you a trust which is total. You must not betray it," Michel Houellebecq reminds us), there's something here for just about everyone. The best part? Most of the best quotes about dogs we've compiled here double as great dog Instagram captionsâ€”and they're the perfect thing to write in a card accompanying any gifts for dog lovers.</p>
